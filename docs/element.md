Elements are simple components that are not associated with models directly but are useful, such as buttons or paginators. They are a complement to Formularium's field rendering to assist in generating basic webpage layouts.

- elements and their parameters:
  - [Bootstrap](api-Bootstrap-elements.md)
  - [Buefy](api-Buefy-elements.md)
  - [Bulma](api-Bulma-elements.md)
  - [HTML](api-HTML-elements.md)
  - [Materialize](api-Materialize-elements.md)
